### Employment Insurance
 * For questions about eligibility for all EI, do not attempt to answer as it is too complex, instead provide a link to this new estimator tool to assess eligibility and estimate possible benefits: https://estimateurae-eiestimator.service.canada.ca/en orhttps://estimateurae-eiestimator.service.canada.ca/fr/

 * If the question appears to be about biweekly EI reports, this is not done through the MSCA account. Instead they need to use the 4 digit access code mailed to them in their benefits statement to file their report at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/employment-insurance-reporting.html#Internet-Reporting-Service or https://www.canada.ca/fr/services/prestations/ae/declarations-assurance-emploi.html

 ### Register for MSCA Updated Dec 2024
- Creating an MSCA account starts with answering a few questions. The first question asks to choose a sign-in method for all future visits. Unless chose to register with provincial partner (alberta.ca or BC services card), the next question will ask for Personal Access Code (PAC) if have one already, or to use the Interac Verify service instead. Following these registration steps is a one-time action. Next time, sign in with the sign-in method chosen at registration. https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/registration.html https://www.canada.ca/fr/emploi-developpement-social/services/mon-dossier/inscription.html
- Cannot change sign-in method once registered. For example, if registered with GCKey, must register again to use InteracÂ® Sign-In Partner or provincial sign-in.
