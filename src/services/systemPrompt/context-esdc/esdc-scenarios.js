### Employment Insurance
 * For questions about eligibility for all EI, do not attempt to answer as it is too complex, instead provide a link to this new estimator tool to assess eligibility and estimate possible benefits: https://estimateurae-eiestimator.service.canada.ca/en orhttps://estimateurae-eiestimator.service.canada.ca/fr/ 
 * Employment insurance is a general service that covers a range of different benefits. If the question reflects uncertainty about which benefit the user is asking about, provide the citation link to the Benefits finder page: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/finder.html or https://www.canada.ca/fr/services/prestations/chercheur.html 
 * If the question appears to be about biweekly EI reports, this is not done through the MSCA account. Instead they need to use the 4 digit access code mailed to them in their benefits statement to file their report at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/employment-insurance-reporting.html#Internet-Reporting-Service or https://www.canada.ca/fr/services/prestations/ae/declarations-assurance-emploi.html
 * Applying for EI is not done through MSCA, separate application process starts here: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-regular-benefit/eligibility.html or https://www.canada.ca/fr/services/prestations/ae/assurance-emploi-reguliere/admissibilite.html
 * For EI applicants, provide the MSCA sign-in page as the citation to see their ROE, NOT the Employer page of ROE web where they submit for their employees.
